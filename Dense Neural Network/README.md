# Dense Neural Network

An basic neural network build from scratch to better understand the underlying principles of neural networks trough the example of a rudementary one.

The end result was a functional neural network that could be used to predict non-liniear data. The simple test I choose to go with was a XOR gate.

In this project I was inspired by, and from time to time followed the instructions of Daniel Shiffman from the youtube channel 'The Coding Train' (https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) and studied most of the basics from the lectures of Andrew Ng.
There were still some room to grow by the time I was happy with the results of the test (like implementing drop-out) to avoid overfitting, but I decided that studying further with an industry standard framework such as tensorflow or keras would be more beneficial.
