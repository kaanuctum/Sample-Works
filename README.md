# Sample Works
Some sample works of mine

## Dense Neural network: 
An basic neural network built from scratch to better understand the underlying principles of neural networks through the example of a rudimentary one. The end result was a functional neural network that could be used to predict non-linear data. The simple test I chose to go with was a XOR-gate.


## Encryption-decoder
Simple Substitution Cipher decoder
A project for solving a riddle published in our highschool's monthly magazine. The main premise of the riddle was that a german text was encrypted, by swapping each character of the alphabet with another random one, but keeping a consistent link between words (e.g. all 'b's are replaced with an 'a')

## OpenCV-Arduino
Arduino Face tracking camera
These are a series of experiments I had with the python library OPENCV to study facial-tracking using a 2-axis rotating servo system I had set up with an arduino plugged into the pc.

## Operations Research

### Simplex solver
The simplex algorithm to find the optimal solution of a linear program.

### SAT solvers
solvers for SAT-3 to SAT-6

## Sudoku
Sudoku solver algorithm
